# Design
design.title=Garden Design and Installation
design.section.main.p1=We provide small-scale design and installation services that cater to your lifestyle and budget. Whether you are interested in having a low-maintenance garden, an edible rooftop garden or the English cottage garden of your dreams, we can help.

# Renovation
renovation.title=Garden Renovation
renovation.section.main.p1=Sometimes a garden needs to be refreshed and brightened up, without a complete redesign. A garden can be given a new lease of life by moving or pruning existing plants, reconfiguring existing garden beds, or tackling a problem spot that has been put on the backburner. If having a low-maintenance garden is important to you, we can help make changes in your garden that will ensure easier upkeep. Likewise, if you are interested in having a garden that does not require a lot of water, or that is kind to the environment, we can make those changes for you.

# Garden Maintenance
maintenance.title=Garden Maintenance
maintenance.section.main.p1=Gardens require care throughout the growing season to stay healthy and pleasing to the eye. We can offer a maintenance schedule that suits your budget, whether it be weekly, monthly or yearly visits.

# Clean-up
cleanup.title=Fall/Spring Clean-up
cleanup.section.main.p1=Spring and Fall are busy times in the garden. We can visit your garden at the start of the gardening year to get it ready for the growing season ahead, or to clean-up and prepare for Winter at the end of the gardening year. 
cleanup.section.main.p2=Maybe you enjoy doing some work in your garden but just need some help every now and then. We can help with those tasks that may be too heavy or time-consuming for the home gardener. This might include:
cleanup.section.b1=Applying a yearly mulch to your beds in Spring or Fall.
cleanup.section.b2=Pruning trees and shrubs in the early spring.
cleanup.section.b3=Dividing/cutting back perennials at the end of the Summer.
cleanup.section.b4=Planting annuals or seasonal containers.

# Kid's Gardens
kids_garden.title=Kid's Gardens
kids_garden.section.main.p1=Spending time in nature has enormous benefits for kid's physical and social development. An activity as simple as planting a sunflower seed and caring for it as it grows into a plant offers enormous learning opportunities for children. If you want to encourage your children to eat more healthily, having them plant and care for a food garden is a great way of getting them interested in food.  Dedicating even a small corner of your garden to gardening activities for your child offers them boundless opportunities for play and creativity. Whether it's a simple sandbox , an enchanted garden for make believe play, a bug garden for the budding scientist, or raised beds for growing gourmands, we can help with all stages from design, installation, and fun gardening workshops to help your family develop a true connection with nature as they grow. 
kids_garden.section.main.p2=Interested in a school garden? We can help with all stages of a school garden too.

# About
about.title=About
about.section.main.p1=I'm Lynsey Dobbie, owner and operator of Growing in the Garden.
about.section.main.p2=I have been working in the horticulture industry for nine years. During that time, I have worked for several high-end garden installation and maintenance companies, building broad experience in all aspects of gardening.
about.section.main.p3=I took the experience gained in those companies to my role as Head Gardener for The Land Conservancy of British Columbia (TLC), a non-profit conservation organisation. During my time at TLC, I managed the maintenance and restoration of four heritage gardens in and around Vancouver. This included the ongoing restoration of a 0.8 acre organic garden. I also enjoyed running public gardening workshops and giving tours to gardening clubs from across B.C.
about.section.main.p4=Since 2010, I have worked part-time as a Garden Educator at City Farmer, a non-profit demonstration garden in Kitsilano, Vancouver. At City Farmer, we are dedicated to teaching people how to compost, grow food, and garden in city gardens. In addition to maintaining our 0.3 acre garden, we regularly run composting workshops and host tours on all organic gardening topics for a wide range of audiences from kindergarten classes, horticulture students and foreign visitors. 
about.section.main.p5=I have completed Certificates in Design and Installation, and Practical Horticulture with The Royal Horticultural Society in the UK. Since moving to Canada in 2006, I have completed a Diploma in Landscape Design and Installation at Kwantlen Polytechnic University.
about.section.main.p6=I bring all this experience, knowledge and passion to Growing in the Garden. I chose this name for my company as I believe that spending time outdoors in nature can help us grow, in many ways.
